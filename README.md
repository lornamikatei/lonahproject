# Cheap Boutique in Kajiado
Slip away to a boutique hotel that is both unique and charming but also has a low nightly rate on your next vacation to Kajiado. 67 Airport Hotel, PrideInn Hotel Westlands, and Hotel Kipepeo are a few we think you will like if you want style and comfort during your Kajiado stay, but you donâ€™t want to pay premium prices. After all, the point of a vacation is to get out and take in the sights, sounds, and culture of Kajiado, not hide in your room.
